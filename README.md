* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?
- The design of the site seems very current and trendy. It is a simplistic design making it very timeless. It appears this way because of its grid system for the photos and the simple colour palette it has.

* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?
- The navigation system is very easy. It has a title system which each category turns into a drop down menu. But when put into a small screen it develops the "hamburger" icon.
- The navigation system is familiar. It is very easy to use and it is easy and simple to find what you are looking for.

* What parts of the site are interactive?
- When you hover over the jewelry it will change to a photo of a person wearing the product.
- With the drop down bar when you hover over the word it changes colour to display which topic you are on. 
- On the about page the banner that you first see is actually a video. 

* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?
- I enjoy the site. It is easy to use, very minimalistic; which is my style. It is very useful for shopping since it has the change of photo right on the main site which also makes it interesting to use. The site is very beautiful. 

* What is one thing you would change about this site?
- While scrolling the help icon is continuously on the bottom right of the screen so while scrolling i would let that disappear so it doesnt distract from the products.
